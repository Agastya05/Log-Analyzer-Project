A Python-based tool designed to automate the analysis of Linux authentication logs (`auth.log`). This script parses log files to detect common security threats like brute-force attacks, identifies successful logins, and flags critical correlations between the two, saving the findings into timestamped reports.

---

## ## Key Features

* **üïµÔ∏è Brute-Force Detection:** Automatically identifies and counts failed login attempts from unique IP addresses.
* **‚úÖ Successful Login Identification:** Parses the log for all successful authentication events.
* **üö® Critical Alert Correlation:** Flags high-priority threats by identifying IPs that were involved in brute-force attempts and also had a successful login.
* **üìÑ Automated Reporting:** On every run, the script automatically saves a detailed, timestamped report to a designated `reports/` directory for a complete audit trail.

## ## Demo

Here is a sample of the script's output after running an analysis.

```bash
$ python3 analyzer.py
